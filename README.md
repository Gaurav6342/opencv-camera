# openCv WebCam with Tkinter

### This project is a simple Python application that captures images from a webcam and allows users to save them using a Tkinter GUI. The code utilizes OpenCV for capturing video frames and Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface.

## Features:
 
**.** Capture Button: Click the "Capture" button to capture and save an image from the webcam.

**.** Live Preview: Real-time display of the webcam feed in the Tkinter window.

**.** Automatic Image Naming: Each captured image is automatically saved with a unique filename (e.g., "gaurav_1.png", "gaurav_2.png", and so on).

## Requirements:
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python-headless)

Pillow (Pillow)

## Installation:

install required package before run the code:

1.pip install opencv-python

2.pip install tk   //////// library like tkinter to create a simple GUI window with a button.

3.pip install Pillow ////// methods for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.

4.pip install opencv-python-headless pillow  //// opencv-python-headless is a version of OpenCV without graphical user interface (headless). This is useful for situations where a 

graphical interface is not needed.
                                             ///  The command pip install opencv-python-headless installs the headless version of OpenCV.
